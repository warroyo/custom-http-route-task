# Custom Container Task for adding an HTTP route

For demo purposes this adds a container task to the `tanzu build` and `deploy` commands so that when the output is generated by the command a `httproute` si also automatically created.


## Usage

1. Create a custom `containerAppBuildPlan`. We can do this by getting the existing one and modifying it.

```bash
tanzu project use <your project>

k get containerappbuildplans  simple.tanzu.vmware.com -o yaml > custom-bp.yml
```

modify the output yaml and change the name to `custom-build-plan` 

add the following to the `runtimes["kubernetes-carvel-package"].steps` section

```yaml
  - name: add-route
    containertask:
      image: warroyo90/add-http-route-task
```

apply this back into the platform

```bash
k apply -f custom-bp.yml
```

1. set the build plan source 

```bash

tanzu build config --build-plan-source custom-build-plan
```

3. deploy or build your app and check the output for the httproute


## How it works

This uses a custom `containerTask` that implements a simple python script to copy info from the containerapp output and generate a httproute yaml file.
